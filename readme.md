## How to install Webstorm

1. Go to the [JetBrains Educational License Application](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) and apply.

2. You will get an email on your university email asking you to confirm your account. Do this, log in, and then go to the [Webstorm Download Page.](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)

3. Download and install Webstorm.

4. Open Webstorm and, when it prompts you, enter your login information.

5. Congratulations, you are now using Webstorm!

## How to install Git and connect GitHub

1. [Sign up for GitHub.](https://github.com/signup?source=login)

2. Go to your profile and create a repository. Give it a unique name but don't check anything. 

3. Click on the `Code` button and then copy the http link. You'll need it soon.

4. Go to git-scm.com and download Git.

5. Open Webstorm and create a new project.

6. Click `VSC` on the top toolbar, and then "Create Git Repository". Then click OK.

7. A new button on the toolbar labelled `Git` should have appeared. Click on that, and then "Commit". Type a message describing the last changes you made to the project, check off all the files that you want to commit, and commit it.

8. Click Git again, and then "Push". Put in the link and your account information and generate a token if it asks for one. Push the code.

9. Go to your GitHub repo. The code you "pushed" should now be there! Committing just means finalizing the new version of your project for upload, and pushing just means putting it up on GitHub.

### Glossary

**Branch:** A series of versions seperate from the "main"/"master" branch, used typically for adding specific changes without accidentally messing up the original branch.

**Clone:** Copy a remote git repository to a local repository. When this new repository is pushed, it will go to a new copy of the remote in the user's own account.

**Commit:** Essentially, saving one's changes to the git repository for transfer to the remote repository.

**Fetch:** Used by one repository to pull from another.

**GIT:** A Command-Line Shell (basically a wrapper for command prompt) that can be used to interact with a remote GitHub repository.

**Github:** An organization who's primary service is the website github.com, which allows users to store their coding projects and use version control.

**Merge:** Reintegrate a branch with the main/master branch. Their changes will essentially be accepted into the original "canon".

**Merge Conflict:** When a branch is behind the main/master branch. This means that code has changed in the original branch that is not shared by this new branch, and thus it cannot merge the two branches.

**Push:** Update a remote repository with code from a local repository.

**Pull:** Update a local repository with code from a remote repository.

**Remote:** A repository stored on github.com, as opposed to "local" repositories stored on your computer.

**Repository:** An archive of code stored either as a remote or local repository. This is where all the code for a project is, as well as different versions of the code if version control is used.
